== 2811 CW3 material

This application displays a user interface that allows the user to select or
create a git repository, as well as edit the repository's configuration. It then
allows them to select and view the branches that exist within the git repository.
They can then view the commits that occurred on said selected branch. In addition,
statistics relating to the git repository can be viewed and/or saved to the user's
computer as a csv file. The user is also able to search for commits, whose message
contains a specific keyword across all branches in a git repository.
